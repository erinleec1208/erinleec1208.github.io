<h3> A Message From the Blogger </h3> <br>
My name is Erin. I am 21 years old and currently a student at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, as well as Metropolitan Community College through online courses.
I will begin Radiologic Technology School at Saint Luke's Hospital in June, and have an overall passion and interest in the medical field and the well-being of others.
However, food is my all time favorite hobby. What I mean by that is anything involving eating, cooking, and the experience of dining out. I wanted to create a webpage
that could be utilized by others who have the same passion as me! The purpose of this site is to show you how I review local restaurants around Lawrence, what news and
events are occurring that involve food, and quick and easy recipes that I like to make on a regular basis! This blog will be updated on a weekly basis, so I hope you
will tune in each week! Enjoy the page, and happy eating! </div></p>
