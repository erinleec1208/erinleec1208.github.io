O'Cafe Korean
</h3></div>
<div class="clearfix"><img class="img1" src="OCafePhoto.jpg" alt="OCafe" style="width:240px;height:320px;">
I am a regular customer at O'Cafe Korean, and it is debatably one of my favorite restaurants in Lawrence. Although it is not
well known, I highly recommend dining here to practically everyone I know - especially if you love Korean food. It is extremely
authentic and tastes homemade. The inside of the restaurant feels exactly the same way; You feel as though you are at your
grandmother's house because of how it is decorated, as well as how the owner treats you throughout your experience. If you
occasionally (or frequently) enjoy dining alone, this is the perfect place. You can sit down and read the newspaper or a 
magazine and be completely comfortable. As for the menu, I have tried 4 or 5 different items. This time, I tried the JapChae
(pictured to the left). It consists of spicy, tangy noodles served cold on top of lettuce. You can choose veggies or any type
of meat such as beef, pork, chicken, or shrimp. I ordered vegetables and opted for an egg on the side. I was surprised when it
came out of the kitchen cold instead of hot, but it was perfect for the flavors of the dish paired with the lettuce. I would 
recommend this dish again, however, I prefer O'Cafe's Seafood Ramen, Bulgogi, or Bibimbap before the JapChae!

Fuzzy's Taco Shop</div></h3>
<p><div class="clearfix"><img class="img1" src="FuzzysPhoto.jpg" alt="Fuzzys" style="width:320px;height:320px;">
In contrast to O'Cafe, almost everyone in Lawrence has heard of Fuzzy's Taco Shop. I am a big fan of Fuzzy's because it is
seriously fresh and everything is deliciously seasoned and flavored. Everything on the menu is simple, but the ingredients
are so fresh and well-seasoned and garnished that it tastes like it should be way more expensive than it is. Fuzzy's is very
affordable and a great lunch option! The way it works inside is you wait in line to order and take a ticket number, seat
yourself, and pick up your food when your number is called. You also clear you table off once you're done. It is casual and
the ambience is fun and lively as the walls and booths are blue, yellow, and red. Fuzzy's also comes alive on weekend nights
as people who have been at the bars on Mass Street become hungry and want to finish off their night with some tacos or
quesadillas. I love the atmosphere, it just feels like a college-town type of in-and-out restaurant that students really love!
Pictured to the left is my go-to at the restaurant: Grilled fish tacos. Like I said, they are very fresh and the fish is cooked
to perfection (not over-cooked). I enjoy the crunchy and soft tacos. I compared these to the new Fish House fish tacos, and 
there was not even a competition- these Fuzzy's tacos win every time.
